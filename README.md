# text-to-code-refactoring
A demonstration of how a raw implementation in JS might be refactored into a fluent style

Starting from this not-very-customer-friendly implementation, I refactored into a fluent style using function names etc to tell the story told in the accompanying comments. 

The rule is that each identifier can contain a maximum of two words. So you can't just have a function called addDonatedVideoToCatalogue().

Part of a series of experimental exercises on communicating through code.
